# x86 Assembly: Data, Memory & Stack

This guide explains how to work with **data**, **memory**, and the **stack** in x86 and x86-64 assembly.  
Itâ€™s designed for beginners who already know basic registers and want to understand how to store, retrieve, and manipulate values at a low level.

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Data Types in x86 Assembly

x86-64 assembly works with different sizes of data:

| Size | Instruction suffix | Bytes | Example |
|------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Byte | `b` | 1 | `mov al, 0x10` |
| Word | `w` | 2 | `mov ax, 0x1234` |
| Double Word | `d` | 4 | `mov eax, 0x12345678` |
| Quad Word | `q` | 8 | `mov rax, 0x1234567890abcdef` |

> Registers also have matching sizes: `AL` (8-bit), `AX` (16-bit), `EAX` (32-bit), `RAX` (64-bit)

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Memory Addressing

### 2.1 Direct Memory Access
```asm
mov eax, [0x601040] ; load value from memory address 0x601040 into eax
mov [0x601048], eax ; store eax into memory
2.2 Register-Indirect Access
```
```asm
mov rax, [rbx]       ; load value from memory pointed to by RBX
mov [rbx], rax       ; store value of RAX into memory pointed to by RBX
```
## 2.3 Base + Offset
```asm
mov rax, [rbp-4]     ; local variable on stack
mov [rbp-8], rax     ; store value into another local
```
## 2.4 Scaled Indexing
```asm
mov rax, [rbx + rcx*4] ; load value from rbp + rcx*4 offset
```
Useful for arrays: array[i] â†’ [base + i * element_size]

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Stack Operations
The stack is a memory region used for function calls, locals, and temporary storage.

### 3.1 Push & Pop
```asm
push rax      ; save RAX on stack, RSP -= 8
pop rbx       ; restore value from stack into RBX, RSP += 8
```
### 3.2 Stack Frame (Function Locals)
```asm
push rbp        ; save old frame pointer
mov rbp, rsp    ; set base pointer
sub rsp, 16     ; reserve 16 bytes for local variables
Locals: [rbp-4], [rbp-8] â€¦

Arguments: [rbp+8], [rbp+16] â€¦
```
### 3.3 Example: Local Variables
```asm
; int a = 5; int b = 10;
mov DWORD [rbp-4], 5
mov DWORD [rbp-8], 10

; int c = a + b;
mov eax, [rbp-4]
add eax, [rbp-8]
mov [rbp-12], eax
```
### 3.4 Function Return
```asm
mov eax, [rbp-12] ; move return value into eax
leave              ; restore rsp and rbp
ret                ; return to caller
```
## ðŸ“Œ 4. Working With Arrays on the Stack
```asm
sub rsp, 32       ; reserve space for array of 4 ints (4*8 bytes)
mov DWORD [rsp], 1
mov DWORD [rsp+4], 2
mov DWORD [rsp+8], 3
mov DWORD [rsp+12], 4

; read 3rd element
mov eax, [rsp+8]
Stack grows downward: pushing subtracts from RSP.

Local variables live below RBP: [rbp - offset].
```
## ðŸ“Œ 5. Pointers in Assembly
A pointer is just a memory address.

```asm
lea rax, [rbp-4] ; load address of local variable into RAX
mov rbx, [rax]   ; load value pointed by RAX into RBX
Use lea (load effective address) to get memory address without accessing memory.
```
## ðŸ“Œ 6. Tips for Mastering Stack & Memory
Visualize the stack: draw RSP/RBP and variables to understand layout.

Step through with a debugger (gdb/x64dbg) to watch pushes, pops, and local assignments.

Experiment with locals: move, add, subtract values on the stack to see the effect.

Track arrays and pointers carefully â€” youâ€™ll often reverse-engineer programs by reading memory offsets.

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Summary
Use RBP as a stable anchor for locals and arguments.

Use RSP to track top-of-stack pushes and pops.

Local variables: [rbp-offset]; arguments: [rbp+offset].

Arrays and pointers are just memory addresses with offsets.

push/pop and sub rsp/add rsp control stack space.
